## Start capturing

1. Capture the first element  
Hover the mouse onto one UI element of the target list, and  when the element is highlighted, press `Ctrl+click` to capture the locator. The image of the element will be added to the wizard window. The locator of this element will be generated accordingly and the count of the matched elements  will be displayed.

2. Capture another element  
Hover the mouse onto another element of the target list and capture it by pressing  `Ctrl+click`. The image of this element will be added to the wizard window too. The locator will be updated in light of the captured elements. Check if the count of the matched elements is as expected to determine if more elements need to be captured.

## Clear elements
Clear all the captured elements by clicking the button `Clear` on the right-top of the wizard window. It is normally used if the matched elements are not as expected and you want to start it over. Once clicking the button, the elements are removed and the button `Clear` and `Save` buttons are disabled when there is no data.  
- Click the `Clear` button
