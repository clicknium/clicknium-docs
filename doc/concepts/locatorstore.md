# Locator Store Type
There are two types of locator store:
- Local locator Store
- Cloud locator Store

## Local Locator Store
Local locator Store will auto generate by default after the recorder captured first locator. Local locator store is a file in the project root path that store the locators. According to the implementation, the store will go with the Python project and it cann't be share to another project. On the other hand, it also means that the code can run offline.
