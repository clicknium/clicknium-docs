# Locator
A locator is a way to identify elements on a web page or desktop app.   

## Overview 
Identification of the correct GUI element on a web page is pre-requisite for creating any successful automation script. It is where locators come into the picture. Locators are one of the essential components of Clicknium infrastructure, which help Clicknium scripts in uniquely identifying the UI elements(such as text box, button, etc.). 
The way to get a locator for a specific UI element is the key experience for automation framwork. Before Clicknium, you have to learn some web essential knowledge, such as XPath. Clicknium provides Clicknum Recorder to help you get a locator by just clicking the elements. 

## How to use
So, how do we get the values of these locators? And how to use the same in the automation framework?
