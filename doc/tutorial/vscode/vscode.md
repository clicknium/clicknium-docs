Besides, Clicknium also improves writing code experience, such as Code IntelliSense, error hint, etc.

***Installationâ€‹***: Install [Clicknium extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ClickCorp.clicknium) through Visual Studio Code marketplace or search `clicknium` in Visual Studio Code Extension marketplace.  
***Remarks***: Clicknium extension has dependency on [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), and the extension will be installed automatically.

The **Capture Technology** indicates which automation technology is currently used to capture UI elements. Default is ***Auto Detect***, which means Clicknium recorder will automatically detect the application type and choose the automation technology accordingly for locators capturing.
You can go to [Clicknium Recorder](./../recorder/recorder.md) for more information.

## Edit and Validate Locator
After capturing the locators, you can open and edit the locator in the editor as below.

You can go to [Locator Store](./../../concepts/locatorstore.md) for more information about locator management.  
For more about the locator, please refer to [Clicknium Locator](./../../concepts/locator.md).  

After editing the locator, you can press the button `Validate` to minimize Visual Studio Code and verify if the target element can be located by the locator. The locator validation result is displayed at the head of each locator layer.

## Writing code
Clicknium provides plenty of features to help you write automation code more efficiently. For example:  
- Auto Code Complete  
For the locator parameter in `cc.find_element(`, you can press `Ctrl+F10` to invoke Clicknium Recorder to capture a UI element. Once you complete the capturing, the captured element will be automatically filled to code like `cc.find_element(locator.chrome.bing.search_sb_form_q)` in Visual Studio Code.

- IntelliSense  
If you want to choose one locator in the locator store, Clicknium code extension shows the locator store list and the locator list for you to choose.

Please go to [Code IntelliSense](./codeintelliSense.md) for more features.

## Run/Debug Project
There are two ways to debug Clicknium Automation Project:
- Run/Debug using `F5` or `Ctrl+F5`, which is the same way as you debug other Python scripts.
- Open the Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P`, input or select: `Clicknium: Run` to run project or `Clicknium: Debug` to debug project.  
It will configure the running/debugging environment. For example, check the Python version in clicknium.yaml, restore dependent package list, etc.   

## Package Project
