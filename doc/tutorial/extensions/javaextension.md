# Java Extension

**Java Extension is applicable to the automation of Java 1.6 or higher applications.**

> **Remarks:**
>
> For applications opened with Java 9+ JRE:
>- Prior to Java 9, JRE included the attach module, which Java Extension relies on to automate Java applications.
>- For Java 9+, the attach module is only included in JDK. For applications opened with JRE9+, you need to manually add this module under JRE directory.
>- Before installing the extension, please close all Java applications.
