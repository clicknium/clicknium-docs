# Locator Store
Locator Store is where Clicknium stores locators. 

## Overview
Clicknium provides locator store to help developers manage locators. Locators will be sent into locator store automatically after captured by Clicknium Recorder. You can edit and manage locators in the store. Python code intelliSense will auto update in real-time. There are two types of locator store: **Local Locator Store** and **Cloud Locator Store**. Clicknium supports switching in both types.  

# Locator Store Type
There are two types of locator store:
- Local locator Store
- Cloud locator Store

## Local Locator Store
Local locator Store will automatically generated by default when the recorder captured first locator. Local locator store is a file in the project root path that stores the locators. According to the implementation, the store will go with the Python project and cannot be share with another project. It also means that the code can run offline.

## Cloud Locator Store 
Cloud Locator Store is powered by Clicknium. After a successful log-in, cloud locator store will be connected. It can be referenced into the current project. The frequently-used locators are stored in the cloud locator store so they can be shared among different projects by even different person. The Python scripts can run anywhere with the Internet access.   

## How to choose


<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b>Type</b> </td>
    <td> <b>Pros</b> </td>
    <td> <b>Cons</b> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Cloud Locator Store</td>
    <td> - Recorded once and used anywhere across projects/computers. <br/>  - If UI changes break the locator, fixing one locator is enough for all projects. </td>
    <td> - Need Internet access.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td> Local Locator Store</td>
    <td> - Offline run.  </td>
    <td> - Need to record each locator for every project. <br/> - Can't be shared cross projects/computers.</td>
  </tr> 
</table>

# Locator Store Management

Supported Store Operations:
- Create new store
